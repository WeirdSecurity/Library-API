üìö Book Library API
A simple and efficient RESTful API for managing a collection of books, built with Python and FastAPI. This project allows you to perform complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a book library.


‚ú® Features

CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete books.


FastAPI Framework: Built using the modern, high-performance FastAPI framework.


SQLite Database: Uses a simple file-based SQLite database for data persistence.


Input Validation: Checks for duplicate entries and invalid data (e.g., future publication years).


Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for common issues, like not finding a book (404).


Automatic Interactive Docs: Comes with interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) provided by FastAPI.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Python 3


FastAPI: The web framework used to build the API.


Uvicorn: The ASGI server used to run the application.


SQLite: The SQL database engine used for storage.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

On macOS and Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:
The 

requirements.txt file contains all the necessary Python packages.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the API server:

Bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
The --reload flag makes the server restart automatically after code changes. The API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
